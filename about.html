								<h4>Danny Antaki, PhD</h4>
							</div>
							
							<p>
								Danny grew up between Little Rock and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camden,_Arkansas">Camden, Arkansas</a> but now calls San Diego, California home. He joined the lab of <a href="http://sebatlab.ucsd.edu/">Jonathan Sebat</a> at UCSD as a doctoral student in Biomedical Sciences. In the Sebat lab, Danny participated with the Structural Variation working group of the <a href="https://www.internationalgenome.org/">1000 Genomes Project</a> and the <a href="https://www.med.unc.edu/pgc/">Psychiatric Genomics Consortium</a>. Additionally, he developed a <a href="https://github.com/dantaki/SV2">machine learning tool</a> to genotype structural variation in Illumina short-read genomes. 
							</p>

							<p>
								Danny has significantly impacted the field of autism genetics. He has shown that the de novo mutation rate for structural variation is not elevated in autistic children, rather the rate is consistent compared to sibling controls. But de novo structural variation in affected children tends to be larger and more likely to disrupt gene function (<a href="publications/brandler_antaki_gujral_ajhg2016.pdf">PDF</a>). Danny helped discover that fathers also contribute to inherited risk to autism in the form of ultra-rare noncoding deletions of cis-regulatory elements that are functionally constrained. This implies that the genetics of autism is more complex than previously thought, and epigenetics and genetic modifiers may play an important role in the disease. (<a href="publications/brandler_antaki_gujral_science2018.pdf">PDF</a>, <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/some-mutations-tied-to-autism-may-be-passed-down-from-fathers/">Summary in <em>Spectrum</em></a>)
							</p>

							<p>
								As a postdoctoral scholar in the <a href="http://gleesonlab.org/index.html">Joseph Gleeson</a> lab, he studied the genetics of brain development, and worked on projects related to somatic brain mosaicism, male gonadal mosaicism, and identifying treatable pathogenic mutations.
							</p>

							<p>
								Currently Danny is working at Twist Biosciences and in his spare time Danny enjoys history, music, and applying programming to <a href="projects.html">fun problems</a>. He also collects ancient Roman coins and regularly updates a <a href="coins.html" title="Roman Coin Map may not work on Chrome!">database map</a> of his coins. When not entrenched in his hobbies, Danny enjoys spending time with his wife and two orange cats.
