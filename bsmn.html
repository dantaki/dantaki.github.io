  <div class="heading4"><a name="_Toc258873267"><strong>Background</strong></a></div>
  <p class=regulartext>The genetic architecture of psychiatric disorders is
    complex. Psychiatric disorders display strong heritability, as demonstrated in family
    and twin genetic studies.  Recent large-scale, genome-wide studies have identified
    associations of psychiatric disorders with several common genetic variants,
    rare de novo copy number variants (CNVs), and loss of function or missense
    mutations.  However, these findings explain only a small proportion of the
    heritability of psychiatric disorders.  The “missed” or unexplained
    heritability could be attributed to complex genetic architecture and
    interactions between genetic and environmental factors.  In addition to
    heritable genetic factors, the idea that de novo somatic variations are
    involved in central nervous system disorders is gaining traction. </p>
  <p class=regulartext>Somatic mosaicism, the phenomenon whereby not all cells of
    the human body have identical DNA sequence, occurs as part of the normal
    developmental process.  Retrotransposon activity, replication errors during
    rapid mitotic expansion of neurons during fetal brain development, and
    electrophysiological activity of the neurons have been implicated in the
    generation of somatic variations.  Recent studies suggest that such variations might
    accumulate throughout the lifespan and be widespread in the brain.</p>
  <p class=regulartext>Somatic genomic variations could occur in the form of single
    nucleotide variants (SNVs), copy number variants (CNVs), structural variants
    (SVs), or retrotransposon insertions. Such variations could alter epigenetic and
    transcriptome patterns, creating functional diversity among brain cells which
    could result in alteration of cell signaling pathways and neural circuit
    function leading to behavioral perturbations and disease. Somatic mosaicism has
    been studied extensively in the context of cancer, but this work has only
    recently begun to focus on brain disorders, particularly neurodevelopmental
    disorders.  For example, in hemimegalencephaly (HMG), mutations in ATK3,
    PI3KCA, and mTOR genes in as few as 8% of the brain cells were found to result
    in cortical perturbations in an entire cerebral hemisphere. Recent
    technological progress in single-cell genome sequencing has made it possible
    for researchers to explore somatic variations at a single-cell level.  Through
    such single-cell approaches, studies have identified several somatic Long Interspersed
    Nuclear Elements (LINE-1) insertions that occur in neural cell lineages during
    normal brain development.</p>
  <p class=regulartext>Although there is increasing evidence of somatic mosaicism
    in the brain, the extent of such variation and its functional significance in
    normal brain development and in psychiatric disorders remain poorly
    understood.  Elucidating the architecture of genetic perturbations in somatic
    cells of normal and diseased brains may provide new insights into genetic
    susceptibility of complex psychiatric disorders and lead to the identification
    of novel therapeutic targets.</p>
  <div class="heading4"><strong>Research
    Objectives</strong></div>
  <p class=regulartext>The key objective of this FOA is to solicit
    interdisciplinary collaborative applications aimed at understanding the role of
    somatic mosaicism in the development of neuropsychiatric disorders. Preference
    will be given to projects which are proposed by a highly interactive and
    synergistic team of investigators with complementary expertise.  Successful
    applications will include expertise in genetics, neuro-developmental biology,
    psychiatry, high-throughput single-cell analysis, whole genome sequence
    analysis, computational bioinformatics, and or other fields relevant to the
    FOA.  All awards supported under this FOA and the companion FOA (<a
href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-14-174.html">PAR-14-174</a>)
    will be governed by a Brain Somatic Mosaicism (BSM) Network Steering Committee to
    accelerate scientific progress through the coordination of research strategies,
    analytical methods and genomic data.  </p>
  <div class="heading4">Research Scope</div>
  <p class=regulartext>An integral part of this FOA is identifying somatic
    variations in human brain and characterizing their role in one or more
    psychiatric disorders.  Under the scope of this FOA, specific areas of research
    interest include, but are not limited to the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li class="regulartext">Identify, characterize and validate the frequency and
      distribution of a range of somatic variations, including CNVs, SNVs, structural
      variations, and retrotransposon insertions in different cell types, across
      brain regions, from diseased and healthy control brains.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li class="regulartext">Identify whether somatic variations are differentially
      represented in diseased brains compared to healthy brains, with reference to
      the extent, frequency, location, and types of somatic variations, as well as
      the brain regions and cell types in which they occur.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li class="regulartext">Apply state-of-the-art methods to prioritize somatic variants in
      coding and non-coding regions of the genome, based on their functional
      relevance to brain and psychiatric disorders.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li class="regulartext">Identify whether and how such somatic variants interact with
      genes and gene networks reported to be associated with psychiatric disorders
      (e.g., using computational approaches).<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li class="regulartext">Trace the origin of such prioritized somatic variations across a
      range of developmental stages to identify how and when the variations occurred
      and assess their effects on downstream neurodevelopmental events. <br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li class="regulartext">Pursue follow-up functional characterization of prioritized
      somatic variants through a variety of approaches, such as transcriptome analysis,
      epigenetic profiling, engineering somatic mutations in neural progenitor cells
      or iPSC lines to assess phenotypes, or by using other novel in vitro or in vivo
      model systems.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class=regulartext>Applications submitted to this FOA should include the
    following elements: 1) comprehensive characterization and comparison of somatic
    variations in healthy control and diseased brains, and 2) determination of
    functional roles for these variations in psychiatric disorders.  Since the
    primary focus of this FOA is to identify and characterize somatic variations in
    diseased human brains, the projects could utilize a phased approach. For
    example, the initial focus of the applications might be discovery of somatic
    variations across human brain; subsequent aims might focus on functional follow-up
    experiments to investigate the role of somatic mosaicism in the development of
    psychiatric disorders. </p>
  <p class=regulartext>Research applications could explore the extent of somatic
    variations across neuronal cell types and lineages, from different brain
    regions, and/or for one or more psychiatric disorders. For example, one
    approach might be to combine state-of-the-art genomic and single-cell
    approaches to rapidly characterize and generate a high resolution map of
    different types of somatic variations across multiple brain regions implicated
    in the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders.  </p>
  <p class=regulartext>Applications are encouraged to apply unbiased genomic
    approaches to evaluate somatic mosaicism using appropriate human brain samples
    from patient populations to correlate findings with psychiatric disorders.
    Comprehensive assessments could include identifying a range of somatic
    variations in different cell types or cell lineages, across brain regions in a
    large number of individuals covering one or more lifetime periods.  For initial
    discovery of somatic genomic variations, applicants are encouraged to propose
    studies using brain samples from human patient populations, rather than induced
    pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines or model organisms as primary source. 
    However, iPSC cell lines or animal models could be employed for functional
    follow-up analysis.  </p>
  <p class=regulartext>To the extent possible, investigators are encouraged to
    leverage existing large-scale, genome-wide data sets and brain sample
    collections from publicly available resources, including but not limited to <a

  <p class=regulartext><strong>Specific
    Aims: </strong>All applications must provide a succinct list of Specific
    Aims of the project.</p>
  <p class=regulartext><strong>Research
    Strategy:</strong> Applications should conform with current guidelines
    taking care to address important elements related to Significance, Approach, and
    Innovation.  As a part of the Research Strategy section, applicants are
    requested to clearly address the following aspects:</p>
  <ul>
    <li class="regulartext">Include a detailed plan for the following elements: a) identification
      and comprehensive assessment and comparisons of somatic genomic variations in
      healthy and diseased cases using global mapping approaches across different
      brain regions from multiple individuals, and b) functional follow-up
      experiments to determine the role of somatic variations. <br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li class="regulartext">Provide a rationale for the choice of cell-types, brain regions,
      number of samples, technologies, data collection, validation strategies, and
      functional readouts for elucidating the role of somatic genetic perturbations
      in the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders.  Applicants are encouraged to
      propose use of appropriate phenotypically well-characterized high quality human
      brain samples from patient populations for initial discovery of somatic genomic
      variations to correlate findings with psychiatric disorders. For initial
      discover effort, induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines or model organisms should
      not be used as primary source.  However, iPSC cell lines or animal models may
      be employed for functional follow-up analysis.  <br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li class="regulartext">Include: 1) utilization of sufficient number of patient-derived
      samples to achieve appropriate statistical power; 2) robust and well-validated
      cost effective techniques and methods; and 3) datasets and functional assays
      relevant to pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders. <br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li class="regulartext">Propose use of unbiased genomic approaches and state-of-the-art
      technologies using appropriate cells or tissues derived from patient
      populations and controls to correlate findings with the pathophysiology of
      psychiatric disorders.  Such technologies should be scalable and
      high-throughput for assessing somatic variations at high resolution (e.g. rare
      somatic mutations at single-cell level).<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li class="regulartext">Propose a detailed plan for identification, validation and
      confirmation of predicted somatic variants including novel rare somatic
      variants.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li class="regulartext">Describe the capabilities for sequence production, quality
      control (QC), storage, data analysis, and annotation accuracy to distinguish
      between sequencing errors and real polymorphisms.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li class="regulartext">A Timeline and Milestones Section should be included in the
      Research Strategy section of the application.  Milestones should be well
      described, specific, measurable, and should include scientifically justified
      benchmarks.  Milestones may include the following: tissue procurement and
      processing; generation of genomic datasets for identification and comparisons
      of full spectrum of somatic variations in diseased and control (healthy)
      brains; computational analysis; validation and quantification of such
      variations; follow-up functional analysis of the prioritized somatic
      variations.  The milestones should be regarded as criteria for evaluating the
      progress and direction of the Research Project  and should not be just a
      restatement of the specific aims. <br>

  <div class="heading4">Use of Common Data Elements in NIH-funded Research</div>
  <p class=regulartext>NIH encourages the use of common data elements (CDEs) in
    basic, clinical, and applied research, patient registries, and other human
    subject research to facilitate broader and more effective use of data and
    advance research across studies.  CDEs are data elements that have been
    identified and defined for use in multiple data sets across different studies. 
    Use of CDEs can facilitate data sharing and standardization to improve data
    quality and enable data integration from multiple studies and sources,
    including electronic health records.  NIH ICs have identified CDEs for many
    clinical domains (e.g., neurological disease), types of studies (e.g.
    genome-wide association studies (GWAS)), types of outcomes (e.g.,
    patient-reported outcomes), and patient registries (e.g., the Global Rare
    Diseases Patient Registry and Data Repository).  NIH has established a “Common
    Data Element (CDE) Resource Portal" (<a href="http://cde.nih.gov/">http://cde.nih.gov/</a>)
    to assist investigators in identifying NIH-supported CDEs when developing
    protocols, case report forms, and other instruments for data collection.  The
    Portal provides guidance about and access to NIH-supported CDE initiatives and
    other tools and resources for the appropriate use of CDEs and data standards in
    NIH-funded research.  Investigators are encouraged to consult the Portal and
    describe in their applications any use they will make of NIH-supported CDEs in
    their projects. </p>

  </div>
  <div class="heading3"><a name="_1._Criteria"></a>1.
    Criteria</div>
  <p class=regulartext>Only the review criteria described below will be considered
    in the review process. As part of the <a
href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11149">NIH mission</a>,
    all applications submitted to the NIH in support of biomedical and behavioral
    research are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the NIH peer
    review system.</p>
  <div class="heading4">Overall Impact </div>
  <p class=regulartext>Reviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect
    their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained,
    powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the
    following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the
    project proposed).</p>
  <div class="heading4">Scored Review Criteria</div>
  <p class=regulartext>Reviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in
    the determination of scientific merit, and give a separate score for each. An
    application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to
    have major scientific impact. For example, a project that by its nature is not
    innovative may be essential to advance a field.</p>
  <p class=Heading4Indent>Significance</p>
  <p class=P_SingleIndent>Does the project address an important problem or a
    critical barrier to progress in the field? If the aims of the project are
    achieved, how will scientific knowledge, technical capability, and/or clinical
    practice be improved? How will successful completion of the aims change the
    concepts, methods, technologies, treatments, services, or preventative
    interventions that drive this field? Does the project address the objectives of
    the FOA to transform our knowledge of the potential role of somatic genomic
    variations in brain function and pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders?  Are
    the plans sufficiently bold to constitute a substantial advance in the ability
    to characterize somatic genomic variations at high resolution, including rare
    somatic mutations at single-cell level in human brain cells/tissues? Does the
    proposed work have a strong likelihood of revealing the extent of genomic
    mosaicism in human brain and its impact on brain dysfunction related to
    psychiatric disorders?  </p>
  <p class=Heading4Indent>Investigator(s)      </p>
  <p class=P_SingleIndent>Are the PD(s)/PI(s), collaborators, and other
    researchers well suited to the project? If Early Stage Investigators or New
    Investigators, or in the early stages of independent careers, do they have
    appropriate experience and training? If established, have they demonstrated an
    ongoing record of accomplishments that have advanced their field(s)? If the
    project is collaborative or multi-PD/PI, do the investigators have
    complementary and integrated expertise; are their leadership approach,
    governance and organizational structure appropriate for the project?  Do the PD(s)/PI(s)
    have prior experience with coordinating collaborative research? Do the
    investigators have documented experience in genetics, neuro-development,
    psychiatry, analysis of high-throughput sequencing data, computational
    bioinformatics, single cell analysis, and other relevant fields appropriate to
    this FOA? Is there complementary and synergistic expertise across the
    consortium? Will the leadership plan optimize the management of a milestone-driven,
    multidisciplinary project? </p>
  <p class=Heading4Indent>Innovation</p>
  <p class=P_SingleIndent>Does the application challenge and seek to shift
    current research or clinical practice paradigms by utilizing novel theoretical
    concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions? Are the
    concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions novel
    to one field of research or novel in a broad sense? Is a refinement,
    improvement, or new application of theoretical concepts, approaches or
    methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions proposed?  Will the data
    arising from these studies support the identification of a full spectrum of
    human brain-specific somatic genomic variations in patient populations to
    understand their role in brain function and psychiatric disorders?  Are there
    innovative strategies for analysis of genomic data that will lead to the
    development of new paradigms for analyzing somatic variations at high
    resolution? Does the application represent an innovative technological solution
    which overcomes current scientific or technical barriers?   </p>
  <p class=Heading4Indent>Approach</p>
  <p class=P_SingleIndent>Are the overall strategy, methodology, and analyses
    well-reasoned and appropriate to accomplish the specific aims of the project?
    Are potential problems, alternative strategies, and benchmarks for success presented?
    If the project is in the early stages of development, will the strategy
    establish feasibility and will particularly risky aspects be managed? Does the
    project employ unbiased genomic approaches using appropriate cells or tissues
    derived from patient populations and controls to correlate findings with the
    pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders?  Do the applicants provide an
    adequate rationale for choice of cell-types, brain regions, number of samples,
    technologies, validation strategies, and functional readouts for elucidating
    the role of somatic genetic perturbations in the pathophysiology of psychiatric
    disorders? Is the primary focus of the application discovery using global
    mapping approaches across the genome across different brain regions from
    multiple individuals?  Does the proposed project adequately address issues of
    statistical power? Are the proposed samples of sufficiently high quality to
    provide high quality results? Are there clear plans for validation of novel
    rare somatic variants? Does the project propose to conduct comprehensive
    assessment and comparison of the full spectrum of somatic variations across
    brain regions in diseased and healthy brains? Does the project propose
    realistic timeline and milestones?  Are key technical barriers and dependencies
    identified? Is sufficient information provided about sample size, choice of
    cell types and brain regions, and demographics, including an inventory of
    existing brain samples and phenotypic measures? If new data collection is
    proposed, is the justification appropriate and compelling?  <br>
    <br>
    If the project involves human subjects and/or NIH-defined clinical research,
    are the plans to address 1) the protection of human subjects from research
    risks, and 2) inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of
    sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion or exclusion of
    children, justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy
    proposed?   </p>
  <p class=Heading4Indent>Environment</p>
  <p class=P_SingleIndent>Will the scientific environment in which the work
    will be done contribute to the probability of success? Are the institutional
    support, equipment and other physical resources available to the investigators
    adequate for the project proposed? Will the project benefit from unique
    features of the scientific environment, subject populations, or collaborative
    arrangements?    </p>
  <div class="heading4">Additional Review Criteria</div>
  <p class=regulartext>As applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will
    evaluate the following additional items while determining scientific and
    technical merit, and in providing an overall impact score, but will not give
    separate scores for these items.</p>
  <p class=Heading4Indent>Project Management Plan</p>
  <p class=P_SingleIndent>Does the application include a Project Management
    Plan describing how different components of the project would operate in a
    synergistic and integrated manner? Does the plan include procedures to assure
    reliability and quality control, comprehensive transparency of data reporting?
    Does the application include plans for maintenance of close collaboration and
    effective communication among members? </p>
  <p class=Heading4Indent>Protections for Human Subjects</p>
  <p class=P_SingleIndent>For research that involves human subjects but does
    not involve one of the six categories of research that are exempt under 45 CFR
    Part 46, the committee will evaluate the justification for involvement of human
    subjects and the proposed protections from research risk relating to their
    participation according to the following five review criteria: 1) risk to
    subjects, 2) adequacy of protection against risks, 3) potential benefits to the
    subjects and others, 4) importance of the knowledge to be gained, and 5) data
    and safety monitoring for clinical trials.<br>
    <br>
    For research that involves human subjects and meets the criteria for one or
    more of the six categories of research that are exempt under 45 CFR Part 46,
    the committee will evaluate: 1) the justification for the exemption, 2) human
    subjects involvement and characteristics, and 3) sources of materials. For
    additional information on review of the Human Subjects section, please refer to
    the <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11175">Guidelines

    involvement with the awardees is anticipated during the performance of the
    activities. Under the cooperative agreement, the NIH purpose is to support and
    stimulate the recipients' activities by involvement in and otherwise working
    jointly with the award recipients in a partnership role; it is not to assume
    direction, prime responsibility, or a dominant role in the activities.
    Consistent with this concept, the dominant role and prime responsibility
    resides with the awardees for the project as a whole, although specific tasks
    and activities may be shared among the awardees and the NIH as defined below.</p>

    <li class="regulartext">The Awardee Institution and/or Research Project Leader's
      Institution will retain primary custody of and have primary rights to data as
      specified under the NIMH approved data and research resource sharing plans
      (described above). These plans should include sharing clinical and genotypic
      data with the NIMH Center for Collaborative Genomic Studies, genotype-phenotype
      data with the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (<a
href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap">dbGaP</a>), and/or clinical and
      associated genotype and phenotype data associated with autism spectrum
      disorders to the National Database for Autism Research (<a
href="http://ndar.nih.gov/">NDAR</a>), as appropriate. The Government, via the
      NIMH Project Scientist(s), will have access to data generated under this
      cooperative agreement and may periodically review the data consistent with
      current DHHS, PHS, and NIH policies. Timely publication of major findings by
      the Group members is strongly encouraged. Publication or oral presentation of
      work done under this agreement will be accompanied by appropriate
      acknowledgment of NIMH support, including the assigned cooperative agreement
      award number. </li>
  </ul>
  <p class=regulartext><strong>NIH
    staff have substantial programmatic involvement that is above and beyond the
    normal stewardship role in awards, as described below:</strong></p>
  <p class=regulartext><em>The
    NIMH Project Scientist (or designated alternate in the event the Project
    Scientist is not available) will have substantial programmatic/scientific
    involvement:</em></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Coordinate and facilitate the interactions among the research
      teams supported under this FOA. </li>
    <li>Serve as a resource with respect to other ongoing NIH activities
      that may be relevant to this effort and providing expert advice to the awardees
      on specific scientific and/or analytic issues.</li>
    <li>Assist in the design, development, and coordination of the
      different stages of the study within their role as a participant on the BSM Network
      Steering Committee.</li>
    <li>Review analysis plans to ensure that they are within the scope of
      this effort and consistent with the results of peer review.</li>
    <li>The Project Scientist will retain the option to recommend
      additional research endeavors or update the timeline and milestones of the
      project as necessary within the constraints of the approved research and
      negotiated budget. To help carry out these duties, the Project Scientist may
      consult with non-NIH experts in the field.</li>
    <li>Coordinate and review with the assistance of the PD(s)/PI(s) the
      timeline for processing procedures, data submission and integration, and
      distribution to approved investigators.</li>
    <li>Serve as a voting member(s) of the BSM Network Steering
      Committee. </li>
    <li>Participate in BSM Network Steering Committee meetings and
      conference calls.  </li>
  </ul>
  <p class=Bullet>In addition, an NIMH
    Program Officer has usual stewardship responsibility for monitoring the conduct
    and progress of the project to ensure milestones are accomplished in accordance
    with the timeline.  The Program Officer carries primary responsibility for
    periodic review and approval of the study protocol in relation to stated
    recommendations regarding continuance of the project, receives all required
    reports and determines that satisfactory progress is being made, and attends
    the BSM Network Steering Committee meetings as a non-voting participant.  The
    Program Officer negotiates throughput, quality control, validation, and cost
    goals with the awardees as necessary and suggests reprogramming efforts,
    including options to modify projects/programs when certain objectives of this
    FOA are not being met. </p>
  <p class=regulartext><em>Participation
    of NIH Intramural Scientists: </em></p>
  <p class=regulartext>An NIH intramural scientist may serve as a co-investigator,
    collaborator, or consultant. However, an Intramural scientist may not receive
    salary, equipment, supplies, or other remuneration from awards resulting from
    this FOA. The Intramural scientist must obtain written approval of his/her NIH
    Institute Scientific Director for the amount of resources that may be allocated
    to the project. The approval must also specify that the conduct of the project
    will comply with the DHHS regulations for research involving human subjects (if
    applicable) and with the PHS policy on vertebrate animal research. The
    participation of an intramural scientist is independent of and unrelated to the
    role of the NIMH Project Scientist. The involvement of Intramural scientists
    needs to be consistent with NIH Policy and all applicable federal laws and
    regulations: <a
href="http://www1.od.nih.gov/oir/sourcebook/ethic-conduct/ethical-conduct-toc.htm">http://www1.od.nih.gov/oir/sourcebook/ethic-conduct/ethical-conduct-toc.htm</a>.</p>
  <p class=regulartext><strong>Areas
    of Joint Responsibility include:</strong></p>
  <p class=regulartext>All awardees under this FOA and the companion FOA (<a
href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-14-174.html">PAR-14-174</a>) 
    will be governed by the BSM Network Steering Committee composed of the PDs/PIs
    of each grant, NIMH Project Scientist(s), and the NIMH Program Officer to
    assist in motoring and developing scientific content and direction of the
    program.  The BSM Network Steering Committee will select, by majority vote, a
    Chair from among the PD/PIs for a two-year term. </p>
  <p class=Bullet><em>The BSM
    Network Steering Committee will:</em></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensure synergistic functioning and coordination across grants
      supported under this FOA.</li>
    <li>Assist in motoring and developing scientific content and
      direction of the BSM Network.</li>
    <li>Identify synergies across projects.</li>
    <li>Coordinate across projects for data standardization and
      validation</li>
    <li>Share data and resource among the BSM Network members and with
      the broader scientific community in a timely manner as per the data sharing
      plan and the BSM Steering Committee recommendations.</li>
    <li>Set research priorities and milestones for the overall BSM Network.</li>
    <li>Guide and evaluate the progress and direction of the research
      conducted by the awardees.</li>
    <li>Establish timeline of expected progression of the research
      activities</li>
    <li>Form appropriate subgroups to develop uniform procedures and
      practices, for example for data quality measures and assessment, nomenclature
      and annotation conventions for data depositions, and so forth. </li>
    <li>Form appropriate subgroups to collaborate closely on selection
      and generation of appropriate cell/tissue specimens.  In these cases, for
      example, common policies, uniform practices (as needed), and data exchange will
      be adopted the BSM Network awardees to enable harmonization and eliminate
      duplication/overlap.</li>
    <li>Coordinate and attend monthly meetings of the BSM Network
      Steering Committee to review progress and identify emerging opportunities for
      strategic partnerships, decide optimal research approaches and protocol designs
      as warranted.  </li>
  </ul>
  <p class=regulartext>It is expected that decisions made or actions taken by the BSM
    Network Steering Committee will be by consensus, or majority vote when needed; the
    contact PI of each award will have one vote, with NIMH Project Scientist (or
    alternate) having one vote. The NIMH Program Officer will not have a vote.  All
    the BSM Network Steering Committee members will attend in person at least an
    annual meeting to discuss progress and share research findings.  Outside
    consultants/experts may be asked to participate in BSM Network Steering
    Committee meetings and discussions, but not have a vote on committee decisions.
    Membership on the BSM Network Steering Committee becomes effective upon
    issuance of the Notice of Grant Award.  The PIs agree to accept the close
    coordination, cooperation, and participation of a NIMH Project Scientist and
    the Steering Committee to facilitate coordination amongst all the U01 awards
    under this initiative.</p>
  <p class=regulartext><strong>Dispute
    Resolution:</strong></p>
  <p class=regulartext>Any disagreements that may arise in scientific or
    programmatic matters (within the scope of the award) between award recipients
    and the NIH may be brought to Dispute Resolution. A Dispute Resolution Panel
    composed of three members will be convened. It will have three members: a
    designee of the BSM Network Steering Committee chosen without NIH staff voting,
    one NIH designee, and a third designee with expertise in the relevant area who
    is chosen by the other two; in the case of individual disagreement, the first
    member may be chosen by the individual awardee. This special dispute resolution
    procedure does not alter the awardee's right to appeal an adverse action that
    is otherwise appealable in accordance with PHS regulation 42 CFR Part 50,
    Subpart D and DHHS regulation 45 CFR Part 16.</p>
  <div class="heading3">3. Reporting</div>
  <p class=regulartext>When multiple years are involved, awardees will be required
    to submit the annual Non-Competing Progress Report (<a
href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11160">PHS 2590</a> or <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11168">RPPR</a>)
    and financial statements as required in the <a
href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11161"><i>NIH Grants
    Policy Statement</i>.</a> </p>
  <p class=regulartext><strong>Recruitment
    Reporting and Trial Registration</strong></p>
  <p class=regulartext>NIMH requires reporting of recruitment milestones for participants
    in clinical trials as noted at <a
href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-MH-05-013.html">https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-MH-05-013.html</a>. 
    While trials in response to this FOA may not seek 150 subjects or more (the
    level at which this reporting has been required), we expect reporting for all
    trials, even those with less than 150 subjects.   </p>
  <p class=regulartext>The NIMH expects the registration and results reporting for
    all NIMH-supported clinical trials in ClinicalTrials.gov, regardless of whether
    or not they are subject to FDAAA (see <a
href="https://grants.nih.gov/ClinicalTrials_fdaaa/at-a-glance.htm">https://grants.nih.gov/ClinicalTrials_fdaaa/at-a-glance.htm</a>). 
    We plan to include language regarding this expectation in the notice of grant
    award. </p>
  <p class=regulartext>The applicants are expected to refer to the project
    milestones in annual progress reports. The funding institute will use the
    milestones, the annual progress reports, and other measures of productivity and
    success to judge the progress, impact, and value of the project. </p>
  <p class=regulartext>Awardees are expected to report on progress with the data
    sharing milestones as established in the NIMH approved data sharing plan.</p>
  <p class=regulartext>A final progress report, invention
    statement, and the expenditure data portion of the Federal Financial Report are
    required for closeout of an award, as described in the <i><a
href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11161">NIH Grants
    Policy Statement</a></i>.</p>
  <p class=regulartext>The Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of
    2006 (Transparency Act), includes a requirement for awardees of Federal grants
    to report information about first-tier subawards and executive compensation
    under Federal assistance awards issued in FY2011 or later.  All awardees of
    applicable NIH grants and cooperative agreements are required to report to
    the Federal Subaward Reporting System (FSRS) available at <a
href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11170">www.fsrs.gov</a> on all subawards over $25,000.  See the <i><a
href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11171">NIH Grants
    Policy Statement</a></i> for additional information on this reporting
    requirement.  </p>
